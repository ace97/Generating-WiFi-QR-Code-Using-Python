# Generating-WiFi-QR-Code-Using-Python
-For this simple project, I used "wifi_qrcode_generator" and "subprocess" functions.
-Using "subprocess" to run cmd/bash commands to get connected network details such as SSID and Password.
-And finally using "wifi_qrcode_generator" I'm generating a QR code with the SSID and Password we got from running script in "subprocess"

-- The arguments to get the values for netwrk SSID and Passwrod may vary from system to system , I had to print the output to see how the values are displayed 
and sometimes there may be hidden tabs/spaces in SSIDs or Passwords so watch out for those little errors.
